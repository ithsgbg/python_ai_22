I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog.  So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.

She'd been living in multi-dog households (meaning four dogs or more) for her entire life. We just have one other dog, her brother. She immediately began ingesting feces from both her and her brother. I'm not sure if this is a habit from living with many other dogs or was brought on by the stress of being in a new home, but I was determined to stop it.We tried a product from Drs. Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful.

I bought it at Lowe's for about the same price on Amazon a few weeks ago.  A couple problems: the hook at the top slides around the short section of wire on the cage that it hooks on (maybe an inch total).  Just means that it doesn't sit perfectly level.  The problem with that is that the birds don't like sitting on the downward-sloping part, so they only use the upward sloping part.  I'm going to try modding it so the hook isn't detachable and doesn't slide, but just stays in the middle so it's level.  The other issue is that the birds don't like sitting on the front/back of the suet cage, I think because it moves around a lot when they land, but every time they try it, there's a lot of wing flapping for a few seconds before they give up and use the other feeder.  This might get better with time.  If it does, I will update this review.  For now, I would say it's so-so for a suet feeder.  I've been looking at nicer more expensive ones, but I'll give this another month (and update this review!)UPDATE: The feeder made it through the season, but I don't think I'd buy again.  Not even sure if I'll put it out next year.  I have another feeder that has space for suet on each side.  That suet gets eaten REALLY quickly, while the one in the cage lasts long enough to start molding (several weeks).

When I'm cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it's more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some \"left over\" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn't bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they've ever known.The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who's pre-recorded message makes you think you've called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, \"re-setting\" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I'm in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I'm not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it's broken I simply can't keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I'm going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I'm going to look into the toilet training kit.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Love - Hate relationship", "unixReviewTime": 1164067200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2006"}
{"reviewerID": "A1QCJOGQL05KRI", "asin": "B00005MF9T", "reviewerName": "Jaw", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I gave 5 stars because i've had three Litter Maids over about 12-13 years and have always been very grateful not to have to clean the catbox--i was able to forget about it for at least a couple of weeks at a time, sometimes much more. I have only one small cat.  You can't beat not having to think about the catbox, it's almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.it's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can't remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.In the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with \"lite tracking litter pearls\" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.As long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i'd just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn't feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I've had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i'm not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.Recently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn't become active, it just sat there.I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the \"dreaded area.\"  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.Oh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn't close completely, that's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn't used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.Update:  10/3/10I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it's supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn't change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn't find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i'm sure.  Even though the crystals weren't saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it's working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.This is different from some peoples' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven't had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "not perfect but i've loved them", "unixReviewTime": 1190419200, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2007"}

This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried. I'm afraid it wasn't our last, as it had numerous problems.First, the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly. I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the \"only\" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it.

The waste receptacles shouldn't need replacement more often than once every month or so.  And while the unit does make some noise, neither of us have found it excessive or particularly annoying.As noted, the above is based upon my experience with my littermaid as well as neighbor Shirley's experience with hers.  Each of us agree that it sure beats the heck out of scooping the litter out every day.  Also, we have noticed that less litter is required...probably because the unit operates about 10 minutes after use, before the urine soaks up a lot of the litter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "4 (2 human-2 feline) of us are quite happy with it", "unixReviewTime": 1041465600, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2003"}

I mean cleaning completely, with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.---------------------------------------I have three cats, all indoor, and you can imagine I've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.I've had a LitterMate (the larger size) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread. we liked it so well, we've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.Pros:Our dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks'. The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.The cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting. The oldest was 6, the youngest 5 months.Scoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day  scooping the litterbox. One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping.  The trays are easily reused, making them more economical.The box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month. The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned. I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial  cleaner solution, and after it's dry use Scotchguard on both.The house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor. This does it effectively.One of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff.  I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal, but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.Cons:Yes - litter does escape underneath a little, but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.The litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it, then just tipped it into the bag. Again, no biggie.Tips:Those lines in the litterbox aren't kidding - don't fill the box over the red line, or the motor will jam.When they say Premium clumping litter, they mean it.  The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.Whenever you empty the tray, pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom. Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray.

None really prevents it from performing its function (eventually) but all add up to a real pain. One problem is that the plastic boxes that the cat manure is scooped up into do not fit very well into their canister. As a result cat litter seeps through the gaps and you end up having to vacuum underneath every few days. It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.A second problem is that the red \"fill\" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).A third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter. The rakes should have been made further apart to reduce this.In short, the machine does do its job but with a few relatively minor modifications (that should have been easy to spot for the manufacturer) this machine could have been much improved._______________________________Update:After less than one year machine breaks down and needs to be replaced.

It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up.  It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it's nice and clean). :-) It's not completely \"no work\" but it is a lot less work than a \"manual\" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes.  I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it's alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full.  You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a \"super charged\" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the \"normal motor\", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it.  It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn't. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats \"recovered\" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they'd seen it before. They said they couldn't repair it because they couldn't get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another \"regular\" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the \"supercharged\" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So, overall it's great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more \"non-stick\" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast. With 2 litterboxes it's not too bad though. I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I've seen.

You may work around this requirement by using plain grocery bags to line the receptacles, but after a few weeks of use the receptacles break anyway.Third, the capacity is lacking; When I got my second cat I found out I had to empty out the machine practically every day. If I waited for the second day, the container would overfill, sometimes because all the clumps were on the same side, keeping the lid open (you can imagine the smell)Finally, my youngest cat has a very fragile stomach. Well let me tell you, the raking process is not designed to handle runny poo. This was the last drop in the bucket, which prompted me to do some research on the web. Six months ago, I bought the litter-robot (litter-robot dot com), and my two cats and I couldn't be more satisfied.In summary, the LitterMaid is great if you only have one cat who never gets the runs.

Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box. The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin.  I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models.  I also build a table with a hole in it.

I still think I got a good deal out of it though.So recently I bought the same litter box again only this time it REQUIRES  you to use the premium cat litter so I bought the \"scoop away\" cat litter at the supermarket. This litter is supposed to be better than the regular litter because it is more absorbent than the regular and it clumps and drys more quickly than the traditional kitty litter. Since the Littermaid Litter box rakes the litter 10 minutes after the cat leaves, you need a litter that can clump and dry quickly. Well, now I get this! Since I bought the litter box (2 weeks ago) I havent had any clogs and am actually using less Kitty litter than before since it clumps so well.The litterbox is turnkey provided you use the premium kitty litter. I am really glad I bought this product. I am happy...Oh, another point, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE KITTY LITTER LEVEL BELOW THE SUGGESTED LINE.

We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one.  With the ninety-day money-back guarantee you have nothing to loose and I believe you will not want to return it.See my full review of the Scoop Free by going to the product or my clicking on \"See all of my review\" link here.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not worth the time or money", "unixReviewTime": 1189814400, "reviewTime": "09 15, 2007"}

I've always found them to be great, but not very long lived.My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.My first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original \"Mega Advance\" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy.This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years....I've never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power's out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop.If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.Tips:1.  Don't over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter.2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more. Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents.  Then replace.  Saves lots of money there.This would be a 5 star if it was just a bit more quiet overall.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Must have appliance for the lazy cat owner", "unixReviewTime": 1252540800, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2009"}
